## Project directory structure

### 📁 Files:

- 📘 **README.md**

    The purpose of this is to inform the user about the project and its structure (this file!).

- 🔗 **README.md**

    The purpose of this is to act as a place holder to put a symlink to the data_indexer to organise what is stored in this project.

### 📁 Folders:

- 💾 **data** 

    The purpose of this directory is to store data, metadata and tables which would need to be read into notebooks and scripts. Information and access these files should be done using the Data_indexer.

- 🌱 **environments** 

    The purpose of this directory is to store yml files of environments relevant to this project. This could include environments for both CPU and GPU jobs. 
    
- 📓 **src** 

    The purpose of this directory is to document notebooks and scripts related to the project. 
    
    In order to track what has been ran it is recommended to also store related github repositorys in this directory. It is recommended to have a directory for the lab github project which will eventually become public.
    
    Optionally, you could also have a directory for a private repo for related work which you want to version control but don't want on the main github for the project.
    
- 💡 **resources_and_examples** 

    The purpose of this dirctory is to store additional files which are related to the project but don't fall into other categories.
    
    Additionally, this section also contains examples of data indexers as well as a template generator script so if the template is update in future to add new directories or default files, it can be run to update the given directory.
