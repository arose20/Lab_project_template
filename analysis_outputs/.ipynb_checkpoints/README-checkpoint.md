# Analysis_outputs

The purpose of this folder is to hold a copy of all main scripts and notebooks for generating plots to show main outcomes e.g. Figures for a paper. A copy of these are storeds here for the project so that it can be easily found.

The groundwork to reach the analysis is recommend to store in a github repo in ./src/Private for your own copy or a team copy and ./src/Public for publishing. 

This folder could also store a symlink to the publishing github repository if stored in ./src/Public or elsewhere.
