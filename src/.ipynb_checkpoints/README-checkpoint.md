# Src directory

This directory is to hold working associated with the project. This could include notebooks and scripts for example.

It is recommended to use github repos here in order to version control your work.

It is also recommended to have 1 repo for the project which is shared between team members as well as a personal provate repo. To help promote this default directories named "Private" and "Public" are already named but this does not mean you are forced to store only private repos in "Private".
